# Traffic Stops in the Collective Lens of Race, Date and Time

Traffic stops are influenced by race, but also by the date and time that these stops are made. Hypothesis 2 introduces the concept that Black drivers are arrested more in the daytime (in conjunction with seasons and sundown time) than they are at nighttime due to officers being able to identify race more easily in the visibility of day.

On the contrary, during nighttime, when Black drivers cannot be visibly identified, they are pulled over less.

As a team, we are utilizing 3 level roll up strategies in order to analyze frequencies within race, date and time.
