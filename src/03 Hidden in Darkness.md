# Hidden in Darkness

An analysis on the frequencies of race and datetime for the traffic stops of Raleigh from 2011-2015. This hypothesis is centered around comparing how the date and time relate to traffic stops made, and then applying that to a racialized lens.

This hypothesis claims that because of the reduction of light and visibility during nighttime, drivers cannot be identified by race and therefore cannot be racially profiled and pulled over. 


### Overview:

We will tackle this analysis by first utilizing the police-with-townships.csv file that contains information about traffic stops done throughout the Raleigh area about 10-15 years ago.
